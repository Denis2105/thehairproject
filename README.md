##1.  Description :page_with_curl:

The Hair Projekt(THP) is a web application by which registered users can post and share their most recent haircut/styling experience. They can enter the price, location, barber/hairdresser name, and rate overall experience for other users or non users. Finding the right barber/hairdresser can be a hassle, THP helps users narrow down their choices and assists them in making a decision as the user has a better overall view of the respective salon.

##3.  Technologies :iphone:

Technologies used to build this app include: Ruby on Rails(v2.3.1), HTML, CSS and AJAX. In addition, PostgreSQL was used in the formation of the database. Trello was used for our group project management and workflow assistance. Heroku is being used as a cloud platform to host our application (below).

##4. Deployment :gemini:

We used Heroku as our deployment platform. We then followed the guideline created by the legendary HMAN1911

##5.  Installation/Startup Instructions :book:


Direct your browser by clicking on the application URL above and load the page.

* As a user you can log in and log out of the website. If you are not a user, create your account by clicking on the 'sign up' button
* Once you are a user you can post a review about your recent hair cut in which you can upload 3 photos(Front Back Side), add shop name/location of hair salon, Stylist name, Price (stars/5). The app will automatically map out your distance between your current location and the hair salon. This functionality keeps you, the user within the app instead of you going out of it to use GoogleMaps.
