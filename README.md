##1.  Description

The Hair Projekt(THP) is a web application by which registered users can post and share their most recent haircut/styling experience. They can enter the price, location, barber/hairdresser name, and rate overall experience for other users or non users. Finding the right barber/hairdresser can be a hassle, THP helps users narrow down their choices and assists them in making a decision as the user has a better overall view of the respective salon.
